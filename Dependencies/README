== Railways Dependencies

Railways requires the following libraries to work properly:

 - simplejson: for JSON serialization
 - flup: for WSGI connectors

We also recommend the following libraries:

 - beaker: for Session and Storage

You can safely add these dependencies to your 'PYTHONPATH' or simply install
these modules yourself if you prefer.
